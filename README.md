## What

This will be a round-table group discussion, where in we cover practical topics such as writing workflows, tools we use, article topic choices, distribution platforms, learning to handle online critiques in a constructive way, best practices for code examples, quality over quantity, and overcoming challenges for under-represented groups.

## The Inspiration Behind The Event
For most developers, the thought of writing an article is terrifying, I want new or aspiring writers to get past that fear and dive in. Writing is a great way to master a topic and share the love with others of what you have learned.

I would also like to explore ways to translate our technical writing ability into higher quality product documentation. We all need to get more involved in submitted Docs PRs to Angular and other libraries.

Also, we as a writing community need to dive in and own our space, we need to actively reach out to those new to the Angular community and provide them with great resources to bust through walls they are hitting.

## Please Note
This is not an official NG-Conf event, but will take place with attendees after the day's sessions. Create an issue on GitHub or contact me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/wesgrimes) if you are interested in helping organize this.
